<!-- Copied a lot of the skeleton from the previous assignment, and adjusted it to fit this assignment. Regarding the resume link, the implication based on the sample appears to be the resume should go to an exterior link. My resume is available on LinkedIn, so I have put a link to that page there.

All images were created/taken by me.-->

<!-- Because there's only been 1 project so far, and I am brand new to web design, I will only put that first project as an item on the page relating to web design. The instructions have requested that the first item is the biggest so that's what I'll choose for that. The other placeholder items are video essays from my YouTube channel, so I can have content on the page. As the course goes on, I will take out these Youtube videos and replace them with the projects I'll be doing. That's why my "subtitle" section also includes a bit about videos. -->

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.
