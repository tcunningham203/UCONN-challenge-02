## What The Application Does, Features, How to Use

This application is a website. It is a portfolio of my work. Currently, I have almost no work to showcase, so there are some placeholder videos from my Youtube channel until I complete more projects. After the boot camp is completed I will return to this portfolio and add more projects.

The header has 3 navigation links which takes you to various points in the page. Smooth scrolling was enabled so you can travel to these points in the page smoothly. The navigation header is designed to travel with the user, so you can go back and forth between sections without having to return to the top of the page.

The first link takes you to an About Me section, where I explain a bit about my story and motivations. When you shrink the page size for mobile, two of the pictures become hidden and only one of the three pictures is used.

The second link takes you to my portfolio. As I mentioned, there is only 1 project so far, which is featured at the top and is larger than the others. The other links go to Youtube videos on my channel. There is an opacity animation when you hover over a video or application, and the title is revealed. For mobile users, the title is always on the screen because there is no hover on mobile.

The third link sends you to the bottom of the page, where you can find my contact information.

The fourth link sends you to my resume on Linkedin. I debated whether or not I should include the resume in the website itself, but ultimately I decided against it because the sample website provided did not feature it.

## Challenges I Faced

Each section took about 5-6 hours. I thought the flexbox stuff was particularly annoying. There are so many variables that can be adjusted. At one point I actually scrapped the entire 3rd section and started over because I was having trouble getting it to respond. But in the end, I did it. I think this will be a good reference for future projects.


## Credits

I used some websites to look up how to do stuff, but other than that it was all me. I did use the previous project as a skeleton, then removed a lot and by the end it looked very different from the previous project. When I used a website to study for a significant element, such as the flexbox stuff, I included a link to the website I used in the CSS file. 

All images were made/taken by me. Notable exceptions: one of the Youtube thumbnails has a picture of Ryan Gosling from bladerunner. Also, the banana is from a "My Friend Pedro" trailer.
